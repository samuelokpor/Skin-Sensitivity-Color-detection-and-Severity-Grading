# Skin-Sensitivity-Color-detection-and-Severity-Grading
in this project, imagine the red sensitive areas on a human skin, and we want to first identify them using a color space to highlight only the red areas and also grade the severity of the red skin present. 99~ 75 is mild range, 77~ 40 is the moderate range and 39~1 is the Severe range.
